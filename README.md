![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Overview

**BGR** is an open-source project that ports the Blockman GO Lua environment into the Roblox Lua executor ecosystem. Designed for developers and enthusiasts transitioning from Blockman GO to Roblox Lua scripting, BGR provides a familiar scripting environment that can run on various Roblox Lua executors (such as Synapse, Fluxus, or other Roblox Lua execution platforms).

This project enables the execution of Blockman GO scripts within Roblox, facilitating development, testing, and experimentation outside of the official Roblox Studio environment.

## Features

- Compatibility with Roblox Lua executors
- Replicates Blockman GO Lua API
- Lightweight and easy to integrate
- Enables scripting similar to Blockman GO within Roblox Lua environment
- Modular design for customization and extension

## Usage

- Obtain a Roblox Lua executor compatible with your environment (e.g., Synapse, Fluxus)
- Load the BGR scripts into your executor environment
- Run your Blockman GO Lua scripts using the BGR environment

## Notes

- This project is intended for use with Roblox Lua executors that support executing external scripts
- Ensure you comply with Roblox terms of service when using third-party executors
